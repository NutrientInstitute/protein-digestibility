# Protein Digestibility Data

There exists a pressing need for a single source of digestibility data. Therefore, we are eager to serve the protein research community by creating a centralized repository for protein digestibility data. The Nutrient Institute is uniquely positioned to take on this valuable project as a nutrition data-focused organization with the funding and resources to execute it effectively and efficiently. This open-access database will be structured with data science in mind, following FAIR principles, to benefit the protein science community and beyond.

## What is in this repository?
Here you will find an excel file containing the most recent version of the data along with description of header names and associated docummentation as well as an R file which contains the code that runs the [live mock-up](https://nutrientinstitute.shinyapps.io/ProteinDigestibilityData/) of the database.
