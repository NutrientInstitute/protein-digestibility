# Protein Digestibility Data

The Protein Digestibility Data Project serves as a dedicated repository for protein digestibility information, addressing a critical gap in accessible data. Recognizing this need through discussions at The International Symposium: Dietary Protein for Human Health and the FAO's call for a single source of digestibility information, our objective is to establish a centralized resource to support research and education. Leveraging our nonprofit status committed to advancing nutrition science through data, The Nutrient Institute aims to play a supportive role in leading this effort. The forthcoming open-access database, designed in alignment with FAIR principles and utilizing an ontology, will provide a structured and easily searchable repository tailored for protein scientists and beyond. It will be a comprehensive source encompassing digestibility values, metadata, and spanning all food types and analytical methodologies. Designed to be a valuable resource for a wide range of expertise, it aims to foster inclusivity by consolidating much-needed digestibility data in one place. The ultimate goal is to encourage collaboration and propel science forward through a unified language.


## What is in this repository?
Here you will find an excel file containing the most recent version of the data along with description of header names and associated docummentation as well as an R file which contains the code that runs the [live mock-up](https://nutrientinstitute.shinyapps.io/ProteinDigestibilityData/) of the database.

Please note that this project is actively under development and data is subject to change prior to a full release.
