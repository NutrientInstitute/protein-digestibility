# Protein Digestibility Data

In the development phase of a groundbreaking, open-access repository for protein digestibility data, the Nutrient Institute invites collaboration from protein experts worldwide. This project, catalyzed by the identified need for a unified source of protein digestibility data and discussions at the September 2023 International Symposium on Dietary Protein for Human Health, aims to create a centralized database that complements existing research. By integrating digestibility values and extensive metadata across food types, and adhering to data science and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles, we are dedicated to enhancing the utility and accessibility of protein science research. The database will promote research and education by providing detailed insights into human, animal, and in vitro methodologies, including both fecal and ileal measures.  We emphasize this initiative as an open collaborative effort, encouraging experts in the field to contribute, communicate, and engage with us to enrich this resource. Our goal is not to replace but to augment and support the invaluable work already being done in the community, fostering a more comprehensive understanding of protein digestibility.

## What is in this repository?
Here you will find an excel file containing the most recent version of the data along with description of header names and associated docummentation as well as an R file which contains the code that runs the [live mock-up](https://nutrientinstitute.shinyapps.io/ProteinDigestibilityData/) of the database.

Please note that this project is actively under development and data is subject to change prior to a full release.
