# Protein Digestibility Hub

The Protein Digestibility Hub Project serves as a dedicated repository for protein digestibility information, addressing a critical gap in accessible data. Recognizing this need through discussions at The International Symposium: Dietary Protein for Human Health and the FAO's call for a single source of digestibility information, our objective is to establish a centralized resource to support research and education. Leveraging our nonprofit status committed to advancing nutrition science through data, The Nutrient Institute aims to play a supportive role in leading this effort. The forthcoming open-access database, designed in alignment with FAIR principles and utilizing an ontology, will provide a structured and easily searchable repository tailored for protein scientists and beyond. It will be a comprehensive source encompassing digestibility values, metadata, and spanning all food types and analytical methodologies. Designed to be a valuable resource for a wide range of expertise, it aims to foster inclusivity by consolidating much-needed digestibility data in one place. The ultimate goal is to encourage collaboration and propel science forward through a unified language.

## What is in this repository?
Here you will find an [excel file](https://github.com/NutrientInstitute/protein-digestibility/blob/main/Protein%20Digestibility%20Data%20-%20data%20and%20documentation.xlsx) containing the most recent version of the data along with descriptions of provided variables as well as an R file which contains the code that runs the [Protein Digestibility Hub app](https://nutrientinstitute.shinyapps.io/ProteinDigestibilityData/), and the [CSV file](https://github.com/NutrientInstitute/protein-digestibility/blob/main/Protein%20Digestibility%20Data%20%20-%20full%20data.csv) the app pulls the data from.

The current version of the Protein Digestibility Hub, contains data collected from the following sources:
- [USDA ENERGY VALUE OF FOODS (Agricultural Handbook No. 74, 1955)](https://www.ars.usda.gov/arsuserfiles/80400535/data/classics/usda%20handbook%2074.pdf)
- AMINO-ACID CONTENT OF FOODS AND BIOLOGICAL DATA ON PROTEINS (FAO 1970) (<b>Note:</b> Original publicatoin has been removed from FAO website, but can still be accessed via the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20231125115519/https://www.fao.org/3/ac854t/AC854T00.htm))
- [Report of a Sub-Committee of the 2011 FAO Consultation on 'Protein Quality Evaluation in Human Nutrition'](https://www.fao.org/ag/humannutrition/36216-04a2f02ec02eafd4f457dd2c9851b4c45.pdf)


Please note that this project is actively under development and data is subject to change prior to a full release.
